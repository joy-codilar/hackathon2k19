# Address Update through Maps Location

This module was submitted by __MageTech__ as part of the Codilar 2k19 hackathon.

This module uses Google maps to help customers choose their addresses on maps conveniently. The module also contains a delivery agent module where admin can assign Delivery Agents to shipments. In the future we will use that information to show realtime shipment location to customers.
